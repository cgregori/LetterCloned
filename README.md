# LetterCloned

A homebrewed webapp inspired by Letterboxd

## Goal of README
- Layout the idea
- What we need to do for the idea
- What technologies we need/learn for the idea
	- MongoDB
	- 
- Time line to execute
- How to distribute the work


## Blueprint
##### C Notes 4/22
- We'll use a MERN-like stack
	- MongoDB
	- Express.js
	- React
	- Node.js
- EXCEPT, we'll use Go for the backend
	- An MRG stack

Database will be The Movie Database (TMDb), since that's where Letterboxd gets their data from

The MVP will be a barebones application, where the main goal is to connect to the database and output information to the website frontend.
