A homebrewed webapp inspired by Letterboxd

# Front-end

Database will be The Movie Database (TMDb), since that's where Letterboxd gets their data from

- Unit Test
- Deployment
The MVP will be a barebones application, where the main goal is to connect to the database and output information to the website frontend.
